## Description
The set [1, 2, 3, ..., n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

```
"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
```

Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"

Example 2:
Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"

Example 3:
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: "123"
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= n <= 9  
- 1 <= k <= n!


## Optimal Approach

### Intuition

The problem is to find the `k`-th permutation of the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]` **without generating all permutations** (which would be too slow for large `n`).  

The trick here is to use **math (factorials)** to directly compute the digits of the `k`-th permutation one by one, using the idea that:
- There are `(n-1)!` permutations starting with each number.
- We can **precompute** which number to pick at each position based on `k`.


### Algorithm

1. Initialize:
   - A list of numbers from `1` to `n`.
   - Compute the factorial of `(n-1)` to represent how many permutations start with each number.
   - Decrement `k` by 1 to make it 0-based.

2. For each position:
   - Determine the correct index by dividing `k` by `fact`.
   - Append the number at that index to the result.
   - Remove that number from the list.
   - Update `k` and `fact` accordingly.

3. Repeat until all digits are used.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String getPermutation(int n, int k) {
        int factorial = 1;
        List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

        // Calculate factorial of n-1
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            factorial *= i;
            numbers.add(i);
        }
        numbers.add(n);

        // Adjust k to be 0-based
        k = k - 1;

        while (true) {
            // Calculate the index of the number to pick
            int index = k / factorial;

            // Pick the number
            result.append(numbers.get(index));

            // Remove the picked number from the list
            numbers.remove(index);

            // If the list is empty, break the loop
            if (numbers.size() == 0) {
                break;
            }

            // Update k and factorial for the next iteration
            k = k % factorial;
            factorial = factorial / numbers.size();
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`
  - Each `remove(index)` operation on the list takes `O(n)` in the worst case.
  - This is done `n` times.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - For storing the list of available numbers and the result string.
