## Description
Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
The '.' character indicates empty cells.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
board = [ <br>
    ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."], <br>
    ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."], <br>
    [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."], <br>
    ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"], <br>
    ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"], <br>
    ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"], <br>
    [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."], <br>
    [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"], <br>
    [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]  <br>
]
<br>
**Output:** 
[ <br>
    ["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"], <br>
    ["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"], <br>
    ["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"], <br>
    ["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"], <br>
    ["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"], <br>
    ["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"], <br>
    ["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"], <br> 
    ["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"], <br>
    ["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"] <br>
]

**Explanation:** The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is shown below:

**Constraints:**

* board.length == 9
* board[i].length == 9
* board[i][j] is a digit or '.'.
* It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.


## Optimal Approach

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    private boolean solveSudoku(char[][] board) {
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[i].length; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == '.') {
                    for (char digit = '1'; digit <= '9'; digit++) {
                        if (isValid(board, i, j, digit)) {
                            board[i][j] = digit;

                            if (solveSudoku(board)) {
                                return true;
                            } else {
                                board[i][j] = '.'; // backtrack
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    private boolean isValid(char[][] board, int row, int col, char digit) {
        // Check the row
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            if (board[row][i] == digit) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        // Check the column
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            if (board[i][col] == digit) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        // Check the 3x3 box
        int boxRowStart = 3 * (row / 3);
        int boxColStart = 3 * (col / 3);
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (board[boxRowStart + i][boxColStart + j] == digit) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(9^E)` 
```
lets denote, n = 9 (the board is always 9x9).
and The number of empty cells as `E`.

For each empty cell, the algorithm tries digits from '1' to '9'. In the worst-case scenario, we try 9 possibilities for each cell, and recurse. so in the worst case the time complexity would be O(9^E). 
```

- **Space Complexity:** O(E)
```
The board is modified in-place, so "no extra space" is used for storing the board.
The recursion stack depth is at most `E` (number of empty cells), since each recursive call fills one cell.
So the space complexity is O(E), and This is due to the recursion stack in the worst case.
