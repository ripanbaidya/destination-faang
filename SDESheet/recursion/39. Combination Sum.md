## Description
Given an array of distinct integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return a list of all unique combinations of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum to `target`. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from `candidates` an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.

Example 2:
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]

Example 3:
Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= candidates.length <= 30`  
- `2 <= candidates[i] <= 40`  
- All elements of `candidates` are distinct.  
- `1 <= target <= 40`


## [Optimal Approach] 

### Intuition:
The problem is to find all unique combinations of given numbers (`candidates`) that sum up to a `target`. A number from the list can be used **multiple times**, and the order of elements in the combination doesn't matter.

To solve this, we use **backtracking**. At each step, we have two choices:
1. **Include the current number** (and stay at the same index since we can reuse the number).
2. **Exclude the current number** and move to the next index.

We keep track of the current combination and the remaining target. If the target becomes zero, it means the current combination is valid, and we add it to the result.


## Algorithm:

1. Create a helper function `findCombinations(idx, arr, target, ans, temp)`:
   - `idx` = current index in the array.
   - `arr` = the list of candidates.
   - `target` = the remaining value to reach the target.
   - `ans` = list of valid combinations.
   - `temp` = current combination being formed.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If `idx == arr.length` (we have checked all candidates):
     - If `target == 0`, add `temp` to `ans` (deep copy).
     - Return.

3. **Include the current element (`arr[idx]`)** if it does not exceed `target`:
   - Add it to `temp`.
   - Recursively call with same `idx` and `target - arr[idx]`.
   - Backtrack: remove the last element added.

4. **Exclude the current element**:
   - Call the function with `idx + 1`.

5. In the main function `combinationSum`:
   - Initialize the answer list and start recursion with index `0`.


### Code
```java
class CombinationSum {
    /**
     * Finds all unique combinations of given numbers (`candidates`) that sum up to a `target`.
     * A number from the list can be used **multiple times**, and the order of elements in the combination doesn't matter.
     */
    public List<List<Integer>> combinationSum(int[] candidates, int target) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        findCombinations(candidates, target, 0, result, new ArrayList<>());
        return result;
    }

    /**
     * Recursive helper function to find all combinations that sum up to the target.
     */
    private void findCombinations(int[] candidates, int target, int idx, List<List<Integer>> result, List<Integer> temp) {
        if (idx == candidates.length) {
            if (target == 0) {
                result.add(new ArrayList<>(temp));
            }
            return;
        }
        // Include the current element if it does not exceed the target
        if (candidates[idx] <= target) {
            temp.add(candidates[idx]);
            findCombinations(candidates, target - candidates[idx], idx, result, temp);
            temp.remove(temp.size() - 1);
        }
        // Exclude the current element
        findCombinations(candidates, target, idx + 1, result, temp);
    }
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(2^T)`
  - In the worst case, each number can either be included or excluded, leading to exponential combinations.
  - However, the exact time depends on the branching and pruning due to the `target` condition.
  - `T` is the `target`, and the branching factor is controlled by the number of candidates and how many times a candidate can be used.

  So roughly:
    - **Worst-case** time: `O(2^T)` â€” exponential due to recursion tree depth.
    - **Better estimation**: `O(k * 2^n)` where `n` = number of candidates, and `k` is the average number of elements in a valid combination.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(T)`
  - `O(T)` recursion depth due to backtracking calls.
  - Temporary list `temp` can go up to length `T` in the worst case.
  - The answer list `ans` will use extra space proportional to the number of combinations.
