## Description
Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.

The span of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price of that day.

For example, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,2,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 2, then the span of today is 4 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 2 for 4 consecutive days.
Also, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,34,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 8, then the span of today is 3 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 8 for 3 consecutive days.
Implement the StockSpanner class:

* `StockSpanner()` Initializes the object of the class.
* `int next(int price)` Returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is price.

**Examples**

```
Input
["StockSpanner", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
[[], [100], [80], [60], [70], [60], [75], [85]]
Output
[null, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]

Explanation
StockSpanner stockSpanner = new StockSpanner();
stockSpanner.next(100); // return 1
stockSpanner.next(80);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(70);  // return 2
stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(75);  // return 4, because the last 4 prices (including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.
stockSpanner.next(85);  // return 6
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= price <= 105
- At most 104 calls will be made to next.


## [Naive Approach]

### Code
```java
class StockSpanner {
    List<Integer> li = new ArrayList<>();
    public StockSpanner() {
        
    }
    
    public int next(int price) {
        int totalSpan = 1;
        li.add(price);

        for(int i = li.size()-2; i >= 0; i --){
            if(li.get(i) <= price)
                totalSpan ++;
            else 
                break;
        }
        return totalSpan;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexiy** : `O(n^2)`, For each call to next, the loop iterates over the list, which can take up to n iterations in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity** : `O(n)`, The list stores all the prices.



## [Expected Approach] Using Stack - O(n) Time and O(n) Space


### Code
```java
class StockSpanner {
    private final Deque<int[]> stack;
    private int currentIndex;

    public StockSpanner() {
        stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        currentIndex = -1;
        stack.clear();
    }

    public int next(int price) {
        currentIndex = currentIndex + 1;

        while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek()[0] <= price) {
            stack.pop();
        }
        int totalSpan = currentIndex - (stack.isEmpty() ? -1 : stack.peek()[1]);

        stack.push(new int[]{price, currentIndex});

        return totalSpan;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`. It seems more than O(n) at first look. If we take a closer look, we can observe that every element of array is added and removed from stack at most once. So there are total 2n operations at most. Assuming that a stack operation takes O(1) time, we can say that the time complexity is O(n).

- **Auxiliary Space** : `O(n)` in worst case when all elements are sorted in decreasing order.
