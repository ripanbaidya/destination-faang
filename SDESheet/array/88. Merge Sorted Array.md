## Description

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].

Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
```

**Constraints**

- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `1 <= m + n <= 200`
- `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9`

**Follow-up**
Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?


## [Expected Approach] Using Merge of Merge Sort O(n1 + n2) time and O(n1 + n2) space

### Intuition

To merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array, we can use a <b>two-pointer approach</b>. Since both arrays are already sorted, we can compare elements from both arrays and place the smaller element into the result array.

### Approach

1. Use three pointers:
   - `i` to traverse `nums1` (up to `m` elements).
   - `j` to traverse `nums2` (up to `n` elements).
   - `k` to fill the result array.
2. Compare elements from `nums1` and `nums2`:
   - If `nums1[i] < nums2[j]`, place `nums1[i]` in the result and increment `i`.
   - Otherwise, place `nums2[j]` in the result and increment `j`.
3. If there are remaining elements in `nums1` or `nums2`, copy them to the result.
4. Copy the result back to `nums1`.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        // Temporary array to store the merged result
        int[] temp = new int[m + n];
        int i = 0, j = 0;

        // Iterator for the temp array
        int it = 0;

        // Merge elements from nums1 and nums2 into temp
        while (i < m && j < n) {
            if (nums1[i] <= nums2[j]) {
                temp[it++] = nums1[i++];
            } else {
                temp[it++] = nums2[j++];
            }
        }

        // Copy remaining elements from nums1, if any
        while (i < m) {
            temp[it++] = nums1[i++];
        }

        // Copy remaining elements from nums2, if any
        while (j < n) {
            temp[it++] = nums2[j++];
        }

        // Copy merged elements back to nums1
        for (i = 0; i < m + n; ++i) {
            nums1[i] = temp[i];
        }
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(m + n)` We traverse both `nums1` and `nums2` once to merge them.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m + n)` We use an additional array `res` of size `m + n` to store the merged result.
