## Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

```
Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

**Constraints**
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## [Expected Approach] One Traversal Solution â€“ O(n) Time and O(1) Space

### Intuition

The problem requires finding the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling a stock on different days. The key insight is to buy the stock at the `lowest possible price` and sell it at the `highest possible price` after the buy day. This can be efficiently solved by iterating through the array while keeping track of the minimum price seen so far and calculating the potential profit at each step.

### Approach

1. **Initialize Variables:**

   - `maxProfit` to store the maximum profit (initialized to `0`).
   - `price` to store the minimum price seen so far (initialized to the price on the first day).

2. **Iterate Through the Array:**

   - For each day, calculate the potential profit if the stock is sold on that day (`curProfit = prices[i] - price`).
   - Update `maxProfit` with the maximum value between `maxProfit` and `curProfit`.
   - Update `price` with the minimum value between `prices[i]` and `price`.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - After iterating through the array, `maxProfit` will contain the maximum profit achievable.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        int curProfit = 0, maxiProfit = 0;
        
        // initially buy the stock at the first day
        int buy = prices[0];

        // iterate through the array to find the maximum profit
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i ++){
         
            // current profit = selling price - buying price
            curProfit = prices[i] - buy;

            // update the maximum profit if the current profit is higher
            maxiProfit = Math.max(curProfit, maxiProfit);

            // update the buying price
            // this should be as lowest as possible
            buy = Math.min(prices[i], buy);
        }

        return maxiProfit;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
