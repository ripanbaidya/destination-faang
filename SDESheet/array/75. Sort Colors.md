## Descriptions

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem **without using the library's sort function**.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```

**Constraints**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

**Follow-up**
Could you come up with a **one-pass algorithm** using only **constant extra space**?


## [Naive Approach] Sorting – O(n * log(n)) Time and O(1) Space
We can Use the built-in sort function to sort the array in-place. However, this approach does not meet the problem's requirements.<br>

- **Time Complexity** : `O(n log n)`
- **Space Complexity** : `O(n)`


## [Better Approach] Counting 0s, 1s and 2s – Two Pass – O(n) Time and O(1) Space

A better solution is to traverse the array once and count number of 0s, 1s and 2s, say c0, c1 and c2 respectively. Now traverse the array again, put c0 (count of 0s) 0s first, then c1 1s and finally c2 2s. This solution works in O(n) time, but it is not stable and requires two traversals of the array.

### Algorithm 
* Take 3 variables to maintain the count of 0, 1 and 2.
* Traverse the array once and increment the corresponding counter variables.
      ( let's consider count_0 = a, count_1 = b, count_2 = c )
* In 2nd traversal of array, we will now over write the first ‘a’ indices / positions in array with ’0’, the next ‘b’ with ‘1’ and the remaining ‘c’ with ‘2’.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        // variables which count the occurance of colors
        int count_0 = 0, count_1 = 0, count_2 = 0;

        // counting the occurance of colors
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i ++){
            switch(nums[i]){
                case 0:
                    count_0++;
                    break;
                case 1:
                    count_1++;
                    break;
                case 2:
                    count_2++;
                    break;
            }
        }

        // iterator
        int it = 0;

        // Iterate through the array and replace there value
        // based on count of 0, 1, 2's 
        while(count_0 != 0){
            nums[it ++] = 0;
            count_0 --;
        }
        while(count_1 != 0){
            nums[it ++] = 1;
            count_1 --;
        }
        while(count_2 != 0){
            nums[it ++] = 2;
            count_2 --;
        }
           
    }
}
```

## [Expected Approach] Dutch National Flag Algorithm – One Pass – O(n) Time and O(1) Space

### Intution
This problem is a variation of the popular <i><b>Dutch National flag algorithm</b></i>. 

This algorithm contains 3 pointers i.e. low, mid, and high, and 3 main rules.  The rules are the following:
* arr[0….low-1] contains 0. [Extreme left part]
* arr[low….mid-1] contains 1.
* arr[high+1….n-1] contains 2. [Extreme right part], n = size of the array

The middle part i.e. arr[mid….high] is the unsorted segment. So, hypothetically the array with different markers will look like the following:

![image1](https://static.takeuforward.org/wp/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-18-171206.png)

In our case, we can assume that the entire given array is unsorted and so we will place the pointers accordingly. For example, if the given array is: [2,0,2,1,1,0], the array with the 3 pointers will look like the following:

![](https://static.takeuforward.org/wp/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-18-171326.png)

Here, as the entire array is unsorted, we have placed the mid pointer in the first index and the high pointer in the last index. The low is also pointing to the first index as we have no other index before 0. Here, we are mostly interested in placing the ‘mid’ pointer and the ‘high’ pointer as they represent the unsorted part in the hypothetical array.

Now, let’s understand how the pointers will work to make the array sorted.

### Algorithm
Traverse over the array till `mid <= hi`, according to the value of arr[mid] we can have three cases:

1. arr[mid] = 0, then swap arr[lo] and arr[mid] and increment lo by 1 because all the zeros are till index lo – 1 and move to the next element so increment mid by 1.

2. arr[mid] = 1, then move to the next element so increment mid by 1.

3. arr[mid] = 2, then swap arr[mid] and arr[hi] and decrement hi by 1 because all the twos are from index hi + 1 to n – 1. Now, we don’t move to the next element because the element which is now at index mid can be a 0 and therefore needs to be checked again.

4. Finally, our array should be sorted.

### Dry Run
Assume the given array is `[2,0,2,1,1,0]`. The algorithm will be the following:

![](https://static.takeuforward.org/wp/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-18-171428.png)

![](https://static.takeuforward.org/wp/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-18-173242.png)

![](https://static.takeuforward.org/wp/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-18-173322.png)

In each iteration, if we check, the rules are always valid. This is how the algorithm works.


### Code
```java
class Solution {
    // swap array elements
    private static void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }

    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = n - 1;

        // Iterate till all the elements are sorted
        while (mid <= high) {

            if (nums[mid] == 0) {
                // Swap nums[low] and nums[mid]
                // move both low and mid
                swap(nums, mid, low);
                low++;
                mid++;
            } 
            else if (nums[mid] == 1) {
                // move the mid
                mid++;
            } 
            else if (nums[mid] == 2) {
                // Swap nums[mid] and nums[high]
                // reduce the high
                swap(nums, mid, high);
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
