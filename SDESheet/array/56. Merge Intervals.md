## Description
Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
``` 

### Constraints
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4`

## [Naive Approach] 

### Intuition
The intuition of this approach is pretty straightforward. We are just grouping close intervals by sorting the given array. After that, we merge an interval with the other by checking if one can be a part of the other interval. For this checking, we are first selecting a particular interval using a loop and then we are comparing the rest of the intervals using another loop.

### Approach
The steps are as follows:

- First, we will group the closer intervals by sorting the given array of intervals(if it is not already sorted).

- After that, we will select one interval at a time using a loop(say i) and insert it into our answer list(if the answer list is empty or the current interval cannot be merged with the last interval of the answer list). While traversing and inserting we will skip the intervals that lie in the last inserted interval of our answer list.

- Now, for each interval arr[i], using another loop (say j) we are going to check the rest of the intervals(i.e. From index i+1 to n-1) if they can be merged with the selected interval.

- Inside loop j, we will continue to merge all the intervals that lie in the selected interval. 

  - How to check if the current interval can be merged with the selected interval:
  We will compare the current interval’s start with the end of the selected interval. If the start is smaller or equal to the end, we can conclude the current interval can be a part of the selected interval. So, we will update the selected interval’s end with the maximum(current interval’s end, selected interval’s end) in the answer list(not in the original array).

- We will break out of loop j, from the first element that cannot be a part of the selected interval.
  - How to check if the current interval is not a part of the selected interval:
  We will compare the current interval’s start with the end of the selected interval. If the start is greater than the end, we can conclude the current interval cannot be a part of the selected interval.

- Finally, we will return the answer list.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        // length
        int n = intervals.length;

        // sort the intervals
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        
        // answer list
        List<int []> result = new ArrayList<>();

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i ++){
            // current interval
            int start = intervals[i][0];
            int end = intervals[i][1];

            // skip all merged intervals
            if(!result.isEmpty() && end <= result.get(result.size()-1)[1]){
               continue;
            }

            // from the next interval of selected intervals
            // we will check which can be the part of our interval
            for(int j = i+1; j < n; j ++){
                // when can be part
                if(intervals[j][0] <= end){
                    end = Math.max(intervals[j][1], end);
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }

            result.add(new int[]{start, end});
        }

        // convert the reseult to 2d array
        int[][] ans = new int[result.size()][2];
        for(int i = 0; i < result.size(); ++ i){
            ans[i][0] = result.get(i)[0];
            ans[i][1] = result.get(i)[1];
        }  

        return ans;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**:  `O(N*logN) + O(2*N)`, where N = the size of the given array.
Reason: Sorting the given array takes  O(N*logN) time complexity. Now, after that, we are using 2 loops i and j. But while using loop i, we skip all the intervals that are merged with loop j. So, we can conclude that every interval is roughly visited twice(roughly, once for checking or skipping and once for merging). So, the time complexity will be 2*N instead of N2.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`  
  - The space used to store the merged intervals in the `ArrayList`.


## [Expected Approach] Checking Last Merged Interval – O(n*log(n)) Time and O(n) Space

### Intuition
To merge overlapping intervals, we can:
1. **Sort the intervals** based on their start times.
2. Iterate through the sorted intervals and merge them if they overlap.

### Approach
1. **Sort the Intervals**:
   - Sort the intervals in ascending order based on their start times.
2. **Merge Overlapping Intervals**:
   - Use a list to store the merged intervals.
   - Iterate through the sorted intervals:
     - If the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in the list, add it to the list.
     - If it overlaps, merge it with the last interval in the list by updating the end time of the last interval.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        // sort the intervals
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        
        // result
        List<int []> result = new ArrayList<>();

        for(int[] interval : intervals){
            if(result.isEmpty() || interval[0] > result.get(result.size()-1)[1]){
                result.add(interval);
            }
            else {
                int[] prevInterval = result.get(result.size()-1);
                prevInterval[1] = Math.max(prevInterval[1], interval[1]);
            }
        }

        // convert the reseult to 2d array
        int[][] ans = new int[result.size()][2];
        for(int i = 0; i < result.size(); ++ i){
            ans[i][0] = result.get(i)[0];
            ans[i][1] = result.get(i)[1];
        }  

        return ans;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)`  
  - Sorting the intervals takes `O(n log n)` time.
  - Iterating through the intervals takes `O(n)` time.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`  
  - The space used to store the merged intervals in the `ArrayList`.
