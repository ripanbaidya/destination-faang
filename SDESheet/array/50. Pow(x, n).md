## Description
Implement `pow(x, n)`, which calculates `x` raised to the power `n` (i.e., `x^n`).

**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000

Example 2:
Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100

Example 3:
Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
``` 

**Constraints:**

- `-100.0 < x < 100.0`
- `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
- `n` is an integer.
- Either `x` is not zero, or `n > 0`.
- `-10^4 <= x^n <= 10^4`

## [Naive Approach] Using Iteration - O(n) Time and O(1) Space

The idea is to simply multiply b exactly e times using a iterative loop.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        // Take the absolute value of n
        int y = Math.abs(n);
        
        // Initialize answer to 1
        double ans = 1;

        // Multiply x for n times
        for (int i = 0; i < y; i++) {
            ans *= x;
        }

        // Return answer with correct sign
        return n < 0 ? 1/ans : ans;
    }
}
```
### **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`  

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`  


## [Expected Approach] Using Divide and Conquer â€“ O(log e) Time and O(log e) Space

### Intuition

The problem requires efficiently computing `x^n` for large values of `n` (both positive and negative). A brute-force approach (multiplying `x` by itself `n` times) would be too slow for large `n`. Instead, we can use the **exponentiation by squaring** method, which reduces the time complexity to `O(log n)`.

The key idea is to break down the exponent `n` into its binary representation and compute the result using repeated squaring.


### Approach

1. **Handle Negative Exponents**: If `n` is negative, compute `x^n` as `1 / x^|n|`.
2. **Exponentiation by Squaring**:
   - Initialize `ans` to `1.0`.
   - Use a loop to process the exponent `n`:
     - If `n` is odd, multiply `ans` by `x` and reduce `n` by 1.
     - If `n` is even, Square `x` and halve `n` (using integer division).
   - Repeat until `n` becomes 0.
3. **Return Result**: If the original exponent was negative, return `1 / ans`; otherwise, return `ans`.


### Simple Dry-run

To understand the process, note that in each iteration, "x" becomes its square, and "n" is halved until n becomes 0. With this in mind, let's proceed.

Consider `pow(x, n)` with `x = 2` and `n = 21`:

Initially, `ans = 1.0`
```
 x = 2  -> 4 -> 16 -> 256 -> 65536
 n = 21 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0
 ans = 1 * 2 * 16 * 65536
```
Updates in each step:
- `x = 2`, `n = 21`: `n` is odd, multiply `ans` by `x` and decrement `n` by 1.
- `x = 2`, `n = 20`: `n` is even, square `x` and halve `n`.
- `x = 4`, `n = 10`: `n` is even, square `x` and halve `n`.
- `x = 16`, `n = 5`: `n` is odd, multiply `ans` by `x` and decrement `n` by 1.
- `x = 16`, `n = 4`: `n` is even, square `x` and halve `n`.
- `x = 256`, `n = 2`: `n` is even, square `x` and halve `n`.
- `x = 65536`, `n = 1`: `n` is odd, multiply `ans` by `x` and decrement `n` by 1.
- `x = 65536`, `n = 0`: `n` is 0, stop and return `ans`.

Result: `2 ^ 21 = ans = 1.0 * 2 * 16 * 65536`

For negative `n`, compute `x^|n|` and then take its reciprocal:
- Result: `1 / x^|n|`

### Code
```java
class Solution { 
    public double myPow(double x, int y) {
        double ans = 1.0;

        // avoid integer overflow
        // convert absolute value of y to long
        long n = Math.abs((long)y); 

        while (n != 0) {
            // if n is odd, multiply current x to the answer and n = n-1
            if (n % 2 != 0) { 
                ans *= x;
                n = n - 1; 
            } 
            else {
                // square x and half of n
                x *= x; 
                n /= 2; 
            }
        }
        // If exponent was negative, return 1/ans
        // if y is negative, then calculate x^|y| and then divide it by 1
        return y < 0 ? 1 / ans : ans;
    }
}
```

### **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)`  
  The algorithm processes the exponent `n` in binary, reducing it by half in each iteration. This results in logarithmic time complexity.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`  
  The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
