## Description

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:
```java
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

**Examples** 

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
``` 

**Constraints**:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
* -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
* nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.


## [Expected Approach] â€“ O(n) Time and O(1) Space

The problem requires us to remove duplicates from a sorted array **in-place** and return the number of unique elements. Since the array is sorted, all duplicates will appear consecutively. We can use a **two-pointer technique** to solve this problem efficiently:

1. Use a **slow pointer** (`k`) to track the position where the next unique element should be placed.
2. Use a **fast pointer** (`i`) to iterate through the array.
3. If `nums[i]` is different from `nums[k]`, it means we have found a new unique element. We place it at `nums[k + 1]` and increment `k`.
4. Continue this process until the fast pointer reaches the end of the array.

At the end, `k + 1` will represent the number of unique elements in the array.


### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) {
            return 0; // Edge case: empty array
        }

        int k = 0; // Slow pointer

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) { // Fast pointer
            if (nums[i] != nums[k]) { // Found a new unique element
                nums[k+1] = nums[i]; // Place the unique element
                k++; // Move the slow pointer
            }
        }

        return k + 1; // Number of unique elements
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
-   **Time Complexity** : `O(n)`
-   **Space Complexity** : `O(1)`
