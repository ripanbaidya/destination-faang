## Description

A `permutation` of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,3]

Example 3
Input: nums = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,5,1]
``` 

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## [Expected Approach] Generating Only Next – O(n) Time and O(1) Space

### Intuition
The next permutation of an array is the smallest lexicographical permutation that is greater than the current permutation. To find it:
1. Identify the **breakpoint** where the array stops being in descending order.
2. Swap the element at the breakpoint with the smallest element greater than it in the remaining array.
3. Reverse the subarray after the breakpoint to get the smallest possible permutation.


### Algorithm
1. **Find the Breakpoint:**
   - Traverse the array from the end to find the first index `i` where `nums[i] < nums[i+1]`. This is the breakpoint.
   - If no such index exists, the array is in descending order, and the next permutation is the sorted (ascending) array.

2. **Find the Swap Candidate:**
   - Traverse the array from the end again to find the smallest element greater than `nums[i]` (the element at the breakpoint).
   - Swap this element with `nums[i]`.

3. **Reverse the Subarray:**
   - Reverse the subarray from `i+1` to the end of the array to get the smallest possible permutation.


### Test Case for Pen Paper Dry Run
`2 5 4 8 7 6 3 1`

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    private void swap(int[] nums, int a, int b) {
        int temp = nums[a];
        nums[a] = nums[b];
        nums[b] = temp; 
    }

    private void reverse(int[] nums, int left, int right) {
        while (left <= right) {
            swap(nums, left++, right--);
        }
    }

    public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int pivot = -1;

        // Step 1: Identify the first decreasing element (pivot) from the right
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[i + 1]) {
                pivot = i;
                break; 
            }
        }

        // Step 2: If no pivot is found, it means the array is in descending order
        // Reverse the entire array to transform it into its smallest permutation
        if (pivot == -1) {
            reverse(nums, 0, n - 1);
            return;
        }

        // Step 3: Find the smallest element greater than the pivot from the right
        for (int i = n - 1; i > pivot; i--) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[pivot]) {
                swap(nums, i, pivot);
                break;
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Reverse the sequence after the pivot to get the next permutation
        reverse(nums, pivot + 1, n - 1);
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity** : `O(n)`
    1. **Finding the Breakpoint:** Traversing the array from the end takes `O(n)`
    2. **Finding the Swap Candidate:** Traversing the array again from the end takes `O(n)`.
    3. **Reversing the Subarray:** Reversing the subarray takes `O(n)`

  - So, the Overall Time Complexity: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.

- **Space Complexity** : `O(1)`
