## Description

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`


## [Brute Force] find Consecutive for each element O(n^2) time and O(1) space

### Intution
For every element x, we will try to find the consecutive elements, x+1, x+2, x+3, and so on using the `linear search` algorithm. Thus, we will check the length of the longest consecutive subsequence we can build for every element x. Among all the lengths we will consider the maximum one.

### Code
``` Java
class Solution {
    public static boolean linearSearch(int[] nums, int target) {
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == target) {
                return true; // target found
            }
        }
        return false; // target not found
    }

    public static int longestSuccessiveElements(int[] nums) {
        int n = a.length;
        int longest = 1;

        // pick a element and search for its consecutive numbers..
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++) {
            int curElement = a[i];
            int cnt = 1;
            //search for consecutive numbers using linear search:
            while (linearSearch(nums, curElement + 1) == true) {
                curElement += 1; // Update the current element
                cnt += 1; // Increase the count
            }

            longest = Math.max(longest, cnt);
        }
        return longest;
    }
}
``` 

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity :** `O(n ^  2)` 
- **Space Complexity :** `O(1)` 


## [Expected Approach] Using Hashing – O(n) Time and O(n) Space

### Intution
Sort the array in ascending order, then all consecutive numbers will appear next to each other. By iterating through the array, we can find the longest consecutive sequence.

### Algorithm

1. **Sort the Array** : Sort the array in ascending order. then all consecutive numbers will appear next to each other.  
2. **Initialize Variables** :  
   - `longest = 1` → Stores the maximum length of any consecutive sequence found.  
   - `count = 1` → Stores the length of the current consecutive sequence.  
   - `lastSmall = nums[0]` → Keeps track of the last included element in the current sequence (starting with the first element).  

2. **Iterate Through the Array (from index 1 to n-1):**  
   - We check three possible conditions while iterating through the array:  

     **(a) If `lastSmall == nums[i] - 1` (Numbers are consecutive):**  
     - Since the current number is exactly `1` greater than the previous, they form a consecutive sequence.  
     - Increase `count` by `1`.  
     - Update `lastSmall = nums[i]` (store the current element as the new lastSmall).  
     - Update `longest = max(longest, count)`.  

     **(b) If `lastSmall == nums[i]` (Duplicate elements):**  
     - If the current element is the same as the last element, we ignore it and continue.  

     **(c) If `nums[i] - lastSmall > 1` (Numbers are not consecutive):**  
     - This means the sequence is broken.  
     - Reset `count = 1` (start a new sequence).  
     - Update `lastSmall = nums[i]` (store the current element as the new lastSmall).  

3. **Return `longest`:**  
   - After iterating through the array, return the maximum length of consecutive elements found.  
 
### Code
``` Java
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if(n == 0) return 0;

        // sort the array
        Arrays.sort(nums); 

        int longest = 1, count = 1;

        // Initialize lastSmall with the first element
        int lastSmall = nums[0]; 

        for(int i = 1; i < n; i ++){
            if(lastSmall == nums[i]-1){ 
                count ++; // Increase count if consecutive
                lastSmall = nums[i];
                longest = Math.max(count, longest); 
            } else if(lastSmall == nums[i]){
                continue;
            } else if(nums[i] - lastSmall > 1){
                count = 1; // Reset count for a new sequence
                lastSmall = nums[i];
            }
            longest = Math.max(count, longest); 
        }
        return longest;
    }
}
```
