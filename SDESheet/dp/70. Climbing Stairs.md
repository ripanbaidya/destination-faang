## Description
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step 
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 45`


## Using Recursion – O(2^n) Time and O(n) Space
We can easily identify the recursive nature of this problem. A person can reach nth stair either from (n-1)th stair or (n-2)th stair. Thus, for each stair n, we calculate the number of ways to reach the (n-1)th and (n-2)th stairs, and add them to get the total number of ways to reach the nth stair. This gives us the following recurrence relation:

* `countWays(n) = countWays(n-1) + countWays(n-2)`
* `Base case`: If the value called recursively is less than equal 1, the function returns 1.
  - if(n <= 1) return 1

* `Note`: The above recurrence relation is same as `Fibonacci numbers`.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    // Helper function to calculate the number of ways to reach the top
    private int helper(int n, int[] dp) {
        // Base case: if n is 0 or 1, there is only one way to reach the top
        if (n <= 1) 
            return 1;


        // Calculate the number of ways to reach the top by climbing
        // either 1 or 2 stairs at a time
        return helper(n - 1) + helper(n - 2);
    }

    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        // Call the helper function to calculate the number of ways to reach the top
        return helper(n);
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexiy** : `O(2 ^ n)`
- **Space Complexity** : `O(n)`


## Using Top-Down DP (Memoization) – O(n) Time and O(n) Space
If we notice carefully, we can observe that the above recursive solution holds the following two properties of Dynamic Programming:

```
1. Optimal Substructure: 

Number of ways to reach the nth stair, i.e., countWays(n), depends on the optimal solutions of the subproblems countWays(n-1) and countWays(n-2). By combining these optimal substructures, we can efficiently calculate the total number of ways to reach the nth stair.

2. Overlapping Subproblems: 

While applying a recursive approach in this problem, we notice that certain subproblems are computed multiple times. For example, when calculating countWays(4), we recursively calculate countWays(3) and countWays(2), which in turn will recursively compute countWays(2) again. This redundancy leads to overlapping subproblems.

### Appraoch
- There is only one parameter that changes in the recursive solution and it can go from 0 to n. So we create a 1D array of size n+1 for memoization.

- We initialize this array as -1 to indicate nothing is computed initially.

- Now we modify our recursive solution to first check if the value is -1, then only make recursive calls. This way, we avoid re-computations of the same subproblems.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    // helper function to calculate the number of ways to reach the top
    // using memoization to avoid redundant calculations
    private int helper(int n, int[] dp) {
        // base case: if n is 0 or 1, there is only one way to reach the top
        if (n <= 1) return 1;
        
        // if the result is already computed, return the cached value
        if (dp[n] != -1) return dp[n];
        
        // calculate the number of ways to reach the top by climbing
        // either 1 or 2 stairs at a time
        return dp[n] = helper(n - 1, dp) + helper(n - 2, dp);
    }

    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        // create a dp array with size n+1 and initialize all values to -1
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, -1);
        
        // call the helper function to calculate the number of ways to reach the top
        return helper(n, dp);
    }
}
```
