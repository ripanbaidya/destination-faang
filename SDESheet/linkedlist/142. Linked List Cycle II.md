## Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that the tail's `next` pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

**Do not modify the linked list.**

1. **Example1**
    
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

**Input:** `head = [3,2,0,-4]`, `pos = 1`  
**Output:** `tail connects to node index 1`  
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the second node.

**Example2**
   
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

**Input:** `head = [1,2]`, `pos = 0`  
**Output:** `tail connects to node index 0`  
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the first node.

**Example3**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

**Input:** `head = [1]`, `pos = -1`  
**Output:** `no cycle`  
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

**Follow-up:** Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e., constant) memory?


## [Optimal Approach] Using Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm – O(n) Time and O(1) Space

### Intuition

The problem is to detect the starting node of a cycle in a linked list. The key insight is to use two pointers, one moving at a slower pace (slow pointer) and the other moving at a faster pace (fast pointer). If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer inside the cycle. Once they meet, we can reset one of the pointers to the head of the list and move both pointers at the same pace. The point where they meet again will be the starting node of the cycle.

### Approach

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Start with two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head of the linked list.
2. **Detect Cycle**: Move `slow` one step at a time and `fast` two steps at a time. If `fast` reaches the end of the list (i.e., `fast` or `fast.next` becomes `null`), there is no cycle, and we return `null`.
3. **Cycle Found**: If `slow` and `fast` meet, it indicates the presence of a cycle.
4. **Find the Start of the Cycle**: Reset `slow` to the head of the list. Now, move both `slow` and `fast` one step at a time. The node where they meet again is the starting node of the cycle.
5. **Return the Result**: Return the node where `slow` and `fast` meet as the starting node of the cycle.

### Explanation

- **Why does this work?**:
  - When the fast pointer meets the slow pointer inside the cycle, the distance from the head of the list to the start of the cycle is equal to the distance from the meeting point to the start of the cycle when moving around the cycle.
  - By resetting one pointer to the head and moving both at the same pace, they will meet at the start of the cycle.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head; // Initialize both pointers to the head

        // Traverse the list to find the meeting point
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next; // Move slow pointer by 1 step
            fast = fast.next.next; // Move fast pointer by 2 steps

            // If slow and fast meet, a cycle is detected
            if (slow == fast) {
                // Reset slow to the head
                slow = head; 

                // Move both pointers at the same pace to find the start of the cycle
                while (slow != fast) {
                    slow = slow.next;
                    fast = fast.next;
                }
                return slow; // Return the starting node of the cycle
            }
        }
        return null; // No cycle found
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` - The algorithm traverses the list at most twice. Once to detect the cycle and once to find the start of the cycle.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
