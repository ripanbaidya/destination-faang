## Description

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

A cycle exists in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that the tail's `next` pointer is connected to. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example1**
    
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

**Input:** `head = [3,2,0,-4]`, `pos = 1`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

**Example2**
   
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

**Input:** `head = [1,2]`, `pos = 0`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

**Example3**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

**Input:** `head = [1]`, `pos = -1`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

**Follow-up:** Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e., constant) memory?


## [Naive Approach] Using HashSet – O(n) Time and O(n) Space

The idea is to insert the nodes in the Hashset while traversing and whenever a node is encountered that is already present in the hashset (which indicates there’s a cycle (loop) in the list) then return true. If the node is NULL, represents the end of Linked List, return false as there is no loop.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        Set<ListNode> set = new HashSet<>();
        ListNode curr = head;

        while(curr != null){
            if(set.contains(curr)){
                return true; // cycle found
            }
            set.add(curr);
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        return false; // no cycle found
    }
}
```

## [Expected Approach] Using Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm – O(n) Time and O(1) Space
This idea is to use Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm to find a loop in a linked list. It uses two pointers slow and fast, fast pointer move two steps ahead and slow will move one step ahead at a time.

### Algorithm

Follow the steps below to solve the problem:

1. Traverse linked list using two pointers.
2. Move one pointer(slow) by one step ahead and another pointer(fast) by two steps ahead.
3. If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet then the linked list doesn’t have a loop.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head; 

        while(fast != null && fast.next != null){
            slow = slow.next; // Moving slow by One step
            fast = fast.next.next; // Moving fast by Two step

            if(slow == fast) return true; // cycle found
        }
        return false; // no cycle found
    }
}
```
