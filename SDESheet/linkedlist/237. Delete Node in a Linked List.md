## Description

There is a singly linked list `head`, and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will **not** be given access to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are **unique**, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is **not** the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node.  
**Note:** By deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. Instead:  
- The value of the given node should **not** exist in the linked list.  
- The number of nodes in the linked list should **decrease by one**.  
- All the values **before** `node` should remain in the same order.  
- All the values **after** `node` should remain in the same order.  

### **Custom Testing:**  
- For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node `node` to be deleted.  
- `node` should **not** be the last node of the list and should be an **actual node** in the list.  
- The output will be the entire list **after** calling your function.  


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/node1.jpg)

**Input:**  `head = [4,5,1,9]`, `node = 5`  
**Output:**  `[4,1,9]`  
**Explanation:**  
You are given the second node with value `5`. The linked list should become `4 -> 1 -> 9` after calling your function.  

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/node2.jpg)

**Input:**  `head = [4,5,1,9]`, `node = 1`  
**Output:**  `[4,5,9]`  
**Explanation:**  
You are given the third node with value `1`. The linked list should become `4 -> 5 -> 9` after calling your function.  

**Constraints**  
- The number of nodes in the given list is in the range **[2, 1000]**.  
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`  
- The value of each node in the list is **unique**.  
- The node to be deleted **is in the list** and **is not a tail node**.  

## [Expected Approach]

Instead of removing the given node from memory, we simply overwrite its value with the value of its next node. and then we skip the next node by adjusting the next pointer.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;   
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity** : `O(1)`
- **Space Complexity** : `O(1)`
