## Description

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return the modified list.

`k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k`, then the left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as they are.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse_ex1.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse_ex2.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

**Follow-up:** 
- Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra memory space?

## [Expected Approach] Using Iterative Method â€“ O(n) Time and O(1) Space

### Intuition

The problem requires reversing nodes in a linked list in groups of size `k`. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k`, the remaining nodes should remain in their original order. 

To achieve this, we need to:
1. **Identify the k-th node** in the current group.
2. **Reverse the nodes** from the current node to the k-th node.
3. **Link the reversed group** back to the main list.
4. **Repeat the process** for the next group until all nodes are processed.

### Algorithm

1. **Reverse a Linked List**:
   - Use a recursive function to reverse a linked list. The base case is when the list is empty or has only one node.
   - The recursive step involves reversing the rest of the list and then adjusting the pointers to reverse the current node.

2. **Get the k-th Node**:
   - Traverse the list to find the k-th node from the current node. This helps in identifying the end of the current group.

3. **Reverse Nodes in k-Group**:
   - Initialize pointers `temp`, `nextNode`, and `prevNode` to traverse and manipulate the list.
   - Loop through the list:
     - Find the k-th node from the current position.
     - If the k-th node is `null`, it means the remaining nodes are fewer than `k`, so link the previous group to the remaining nodes and break out of the loop.
     - Preserve the next node after the k-th node.
     - Disconnect the k-th node from the rest of the list to isolate the current group.
     - Reverse the current group.
     - If it's the first group, update the head of the list.
     - Otherwise, link the previous group to the reversed group.
     - Update `prevNode` to the last node of the current group.
     - Move `temp` to the next node to process the next group.

4. **Return the Modified List**:
   - After processing all groups, return the head of the modified linked list.


### Code
```java
class Solution {
    // Reverse a linked list
    public ListNode reverse(ListNode head) {
        if (head.next == null || head == null) return head;

        ListNode newHead = reverse(head.next);

        ListNode front = head.next;
        front.next = head;
        head.next = null;

        return newHead;
    }

    // Get the k-th node from the current node
    public ListNode getKthNode(ListNode head, int k) {
        k -= 1;
        while (head != null && k > 0) {
            head = head.next;
            k--;
        }
        return head;
    }

    // Reverse nodes in k-group
    public ListNode reverseKGroup(ListNode head, int k) {
        ListNode temp = head, nextNode = null, prevNode = null;

        while (temp != null) {
            ListNode kthNode = getKthNode(temp, k);

            if (kthNode == null) { // If k-group is not present
                if (prevNode != null) {
                    prevNode.next = temp;
                    break;
                }
            }
            nextNode = kthNode.next; // Preserve the next node after k-th node
            kthNode.next = null; // Disconnect the k-th node to isolate the group

            kthNode = reverse(temp); // Reverse the current group

            // Link the reversed group back to the main list
            if (temp == head) { // If it's the first group
                head = kthNode; // Update the head of the list
            } else {
                prevNode.next = kthNode;
            }

            prevNode = temp; // Preserve the last node of the current group
            temp = nextNode; // Move to the next group
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```
### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n + n)` ~ `O(n)`
  - The first `O(n)` comes from traversing the list to find the k-th node.
  - The second `O(n)` comes from reversing the nodes in each group.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
