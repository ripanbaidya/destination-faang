## Description

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/rotate1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/roate2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]
``` 

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 500]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `0 <= k <= 2 * 10^9`


## [Expected Approach] By changing pointer of kth node â€“ O(n) Time and O(1) Space

### **Intuition**

To rotate a linked list to the right by `k` places, we need to move the last `k` nodes to the front. The key insight is that rotating a list of length `len` by `k` places (where `k` could be larger than `len`) is equivalent to rotating it by `k % len` places.

### **Approach**

1. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty (`head == null`) or has only one node (`head.next == null`), return `head` as no rotation is needed.

2. Calculate Length of the linked list.

3. **Normalize `k`**:
   - Reduce `k` using modulo operation (`k = k % len`) to handle cases where `k` is larger than the list length.
   - If `k` becomes `0` after normalization, return `head` as no rotation is needed.

4. **Find the New Head**:
   - The new head of the rotated list will be the node at position `len - k`.
   - Traverse to the node just before this new head (`kprevIdx = len - k - 1`).
   - Split the list at this node: set `temp.next = null` to break the list.

5. **Attach the Rotated Part**:
   - The part from the new head to the end of the original list becomes the start of the rotated list.
   - Traverse to the end of this new list and attach the original head to complete the rotation.


### **Interview Explanation**

> *"We first compute the length of the list to handle cases where `k` is larger than the list. The effective rotation is `k % len`. We then split the list at the `len - k`-th node, making the next node the new head. Finally, we attach the original head to the end of the new list."*

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int length(ListNode head){
        int len = 0;
        while(head != null){
            len ++;
            head = head.next;
        }
        return len;
    }
    public ListNode rotateRight(ListNode head, int k) {
        if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        
        int len = length(head);

        k = k % len;
        
        if(k == 0 || len == k) return head;

        int kprevIdx = len - k - 1;
        ListNode temp = head;
        
        // move the prev of kth node
        for(int i = 0; i < kprevIdx; i ++){
            temp = temp.next;
        }
        ListNode kthNode = temp.next;
        temp.next = null; // make kth prev point to null

        ListNode rotatedHead = kthNode;
        while(kthNode.next != null){
            kthNode = kthNode.next; 
        }

        kthNode.next = head;

        return rotatedHead;
    }   
}
```
