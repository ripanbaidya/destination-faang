## Description
There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

* There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
* There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
* If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
* The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.

A graph is `bipartite` if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

Return `true` if and only if it is bipartite.

Example 1:
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.

```
Example 2:
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```

**Constraints:**

* graph.length == n
* 1 <= n <= 100
* 0 <= graph[u].length < n
* 0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1
* graph[u] does not contain u.
* All the values of graph[u] are unique.
* If graph[u] contains v, then graph[v] contains u.


## Using Breadth-First Search (BFS)

### Intution
Checking if a graph is bipartite is like trying to color the graph using only two colors, so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. One approach is to check whether the graph is 2-colorable or not using backtracking algorithm `M coloring problem`.

A common and efficient way to solve this is by using Breadth-First Search (BFS). The idea is to traverse the graph level by level and assign colors alternately to the vertices as we proceed.

### Approach
* Start BFS from any uncolored vertex and assign it color 0.
* For each vertex, color its uncolored neighbors with the opposite color (1 if current is 0, and vice versa)
  * Check if a neighbor already has the same color as the current vertex, return false (graph is not bipartite).
  
* If BFS completes without any conflicts, return true (graph is bipartite).

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean bfs(int u, int[][] graph, int[] color){
        color[u] = 0; // start coloring with 0 
        Queue<Integer> q= new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(u);

        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            int node = q.poll();

            for(int neighbor : graph[node]){
                if(color[neighbor] == -1){
                    color[neighbor] = 1 - color[node]; // assing opposite color
                    q.offer(neighbor);
                }
                // same color on both sides
                else if(color[neighbor] == color[node]){
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        int[] color = new int[n];
        
        // Initialize all vertices as uncolored (-1)
        Arrays.fill(color, -1);

        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++ i){
            if(color[i] == -1 && !bfs(i, graph, color))
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This is because BFS explores each vertex and edge exactly once.

* **Auxiliary Space**: `O(V)`, The queue used in BFS, which can hold up to V vertices and The color array (or map), which stores the color for each vertex, We do not count the adjacency list in auxiliary space as it is necessary for representing the input graph.


## Using Depth-First Search (DFS)

### Intution
To check if a graph is bipartite using `Depth-First Search (DFS)`, we need to color the graph with two colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We start from any uncolored vertex, assigning it a color (e.g., color 0). As we explore each vertex, we recursively color its uncolored neighbors with the another color. If we ever find a neighbor that shares the same color as the current vertex, we can simply conclude that the graph is not bipartite. If there is no conflict found after the traversal then the given graph is bipartite.

### Approach
* Create a colors array where all vertices are initialized to -1 (uncolored).
* Iterate through all vertices and for each vertex, if it is uncolored, start a DFS from that vertex.

  * Assign a color (0 or 1) to the current vertex.
  * Visit all adjacent vertices, if its color is same as current vertex, return false (not bipartite), otherwise assign opposite color and continue DFS.
* If all vertices can be colored without conflicts, return true (graph is bipartite).

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean dfs(int node, int[][] graph, int[] color){
        color[node] = 0;

        for(int neighbor : graph[node]){
            if(color[neighbor] == -1){
                color[neighbor] = 1 - color[node]; // assing opposite color
                
                if(!dfs(neighbor, graph, color))    
                    return false;
            }
            // same color on both sides
            else if(color[neighbor] == color[node]){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        int[] color = new int[n];
        
        // Initialize all vertices as uncolored (-1)
        Arrays.fill(color, -1);

        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++ i){
            if(color[i] == -1 && !dfs(i, graph, color))
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This is because DFS explores each vertex and edge exactly once.

* **Auxiliary Space**: `O(V)`, for color array and recursion call stack, We do not count the adjacency list in auxiliary space as it is necessary for representing the input graph.
