## Description
You are given an image represented by an m x n grid of integers image, where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. Your task is to perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

To perform a flood fill:
```
Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to color.
Perform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares the same color as the starting pixel.
Keep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated pixels and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.
The process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the original color to update.
Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.
```

```
Example 1:

Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2

Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]

Explanation:

From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.

Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not horizontally or vertically connected to the starting pixel.
```
```
Example 2:

Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0

Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]

Explanation:

The starting pixel is already colored with 0, which is the same as the target color. Therefore, no changes are made to the image.
```
 
**Constraints:**

- m == image.length
- n == image[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- 0 <= image[i][j], color < 216
- 0 <= sr < m
- 0 <= sc < n

## [Expected Solution] Using DFS - O(n * m) time & O(n * m) space

### Intuition

We are given an image represented as a 2D matrix, and a starting cell `(sr, sc)` with a specified `newColor`. The goal is to change the color of the starting cell and **all 4-directionally connected** cells (up, down, left, right) that share the **same original color** (`image[sr][sc]`) to the `newColor`.

To achieve this, we can use a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** approach. Starting from `(sr, sc)`, we recursively traverse to adjacent cells that have the same initial color and update them to the `newColor`. DFS ensures we reach all such connected cells.


### Algorithm

1. **Initialize**:

   * Store the initial color from `image[sr][sc]` in a variable `iniColor`.
   * Prepare the answer matrix `ans`, initially referencing the original image (in-place update).
   * Define `delRow` and `delCol` arrays to represent the 4 directions (up, right, down, left) in which we can move.

2. **DFS Function**:

   * Create a helper function `dfs(row, col, image, ans, iniColor, newColor, delRow, delCol)`.
   * In the DFS:

     * Change the color of the current cell to `newColor` in the `ans` matrix.
     * Loop through all 4 directions:

       * Compute the neighboring cell's coordinates.
       * Check bounds and whether the neighbor has the same initial color and hasn't been updated yet.
       * If valid, recursively call DFS on that neighbor.

3. **Start DFS** from `(sr, sc)`.

4. **Return** the modified `ans` matrix.


### Code

```java
class Solution {
    private void dfs(int row, int col, int[][] image, int[][] ans, int iniColor, int newColor,
                     int[] delRow, int[] delCol) {
        
        // Update the color of the current cell
        ans[row][col] = newColor;
        
        int n = image.length;
        int m = image[0].length;
        
        // Explore all 4 directions
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int nrow = row + delRow[i];
            int ncol = col + delCol[i];

            // Check bounds and conditions to recurse
            if (nrow >= 0 && nrow < n && ncol >= 0 && ncol < m &&
                image[nrow][ncol] == iniColor && ans[nrow][ncol] != newColor) {
                dfs(nrow, ncol, image, ans, iniColor, newColor, delRow, delCol);
            }
        }
    }

    public int[][] floodFill(int[][] image, int sr, int sc, int color) {
        int iniColor = image[sr][sc];
        int[][] ans = image;
        
        // If the color is already the same, no need to change
        if (iniColor == color) return ans;

        // Direction vectors: up, right, down, left
        int[] delRow = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
        int[] delCol = {0, 1, 0, -1};

        // Start DFS
        dfs(sr, sc, image, ans, iniColor, color, delRow, delCol);

        return ans;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- `Time Complexity` : **O(N × M)**: In the worst case, we may visit every cell in the matrix once, where `N` is the number of rows and `M` is the number of columns.

- `Space Complexity` : **O(N × M)** (in the worst case, due to recursive call stack in DFS).
