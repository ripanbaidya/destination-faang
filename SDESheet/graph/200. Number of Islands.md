## Description
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

```
Example  1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 300
- grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.


## Using Breadth First Search â€“ O(n * m) time and O(n * m) space

### Approach

1. Initialize a boolean matrix of the same size as the given matrix to keep track of visited cells.
2. Traverse the given matrix, and for each unvisited cell that is part of an island, perform BFS starting from that cell.
3. In the BFS algorithm, enqueue the current cell and mark it as visited. Then, while the queue is not empty, dequeue a cell and enqueue its unvisited neighbors that are part of the same island. Mark each of these neighbors as visited.
4. After BFS is complete, increment the island count by 1.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all unvisited cells have been processed.
6. Return the total island count.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    private void bfs(int row, int col, char[][] grid, boolean[][] vis, int[] delRow, int[] delCol){
        Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();
        int n = grid.length;
        int m = grid[0].length;

        // put the element into the queue and mark them as visited
        q.offer(new int[]{row, col});
        vis[row][col] = true;

        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            int[] node = q.poll();
            int r = node[0];
            int c = node[1];

            // explore all 4 directions
            for(int i = 0; i < 4; i ++){
                int nrow = r + delRow[i];
                int ncol = c + delCol[i];
                
                // Check bounds and conditions to recurse
                if(nrow >= 0 && nrow < n && ncol >= 0 && ncol < m
                    && grid[nrow][ncol] == '1' && !vis[nrow][ncol]){
                    vis[nrow][ncol] = true;
                    q.offer(new int[]{nrow, ncol});
                }
            }
        }
    }
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int m = grid[0].length; 
        int count = 0; // number of islands

        boolean[][] vis= new boolean[n][m];
        // Direction vectors: up, right, down, left
        int[] delRow = {-1, 0, 1, 0};
        int[] delCol = {0, 1, 0, -1};

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i ++){
            for(int j = 0; j < m; j ++){
                if(!vis[i][j] && grid[i][j] == '1'){
                    bfs(i, j, grid, vis, delRow, delCol);
                    count ++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
