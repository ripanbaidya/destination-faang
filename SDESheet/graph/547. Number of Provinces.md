## Description
There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

Example 1:
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

```
Example 2:
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
``` 

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= n <= 200
- n == isConnected.length
- n == isConnected[i].length
- isConnected[i][j] is 1 or 0.
- isConnected[i][i] == 1
- isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]


## Solutions
To determine the number of provinces, we need to count the number of connected components in the graph, where each component represents a province. We can achieve this by using graph traversal techniques such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). By maintaining a visited array, we can track the cities that have already been visited during the traversal, ensuring that each component is counted only once.

## Solving from given Adjacency List

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    /**
     * Converts adjacency matrix to adjacency list
     */
    public List<List<Integer>> convertToAdjList(int[][] mat) {
        int numCities = mat.length;
        List<List<Integer>> adjList = new ArrayList<>(numCities);

        for (int i = 0; i < numCities; i++) {
            adjList.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < numCities; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < mat[i].length; j++) {
                // when there is an edge and it is not a self loop
                if (mat[i][j] == 1 && i != j) {
                    adjList.get(i).add(j);
                    adjList.get(j).add(i);
                }
            }
        }
        return adjList;
    }

    /**
     * Performs Depth First Search on the graph
     */
    public void dfs(int node, List<List<Integer>> adj, boolean[] visited) {
        // Mark the node as visited
        visited[node] = true;

        for (int neighbor : adj.get(node)) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                dfs(neighbor, adj, visited);
            }
        }
    }

    /**
     * Finds the number of connected components in the graph
     */
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] isConnected) {
        int numCities = isConnected.length;
        List<List<Integer>> adjList = convertToAdjList(isConnected);
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[numCities];

        // count number of Connected Components
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < numCities; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfs(i, adjList, visited);
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity** : `O(V) + O(2*E)`, We have converted the adjacency matrix into adjacency list, where n is the number of cities and E is the number of edges. This conversion does not affect the time complexity of the algorithm.
    
- **space Complexity** : `O(N)`



## Solve from given Adjacency Matrix 

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    /**
     * Performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph from the given city.
     */
    private void depthFirstSearch(int city, int numCities, int[][] isConnected, boolean[] visited) {
        // Mark the current city as visited.
        visited[city] = true;

        // Iterate through all cities to check if they are connected to the current city.
        for (int neighbor = 0; neighbor < numCities; neighbor++) {
            // If the neighbor is not visited and is connected to the current city, do a DFS from the neighbor.
            if (!visited[neighbor] && isConnected[city][neighbor] == 1) {
                depthFirstSearch(neighbor, numCities, isConnected, visited);
            }
        }
    }

    /**
     * Finds the number of connected components in the graph.
     */
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] isConnected) {
        // Get the number of cities in the graph.
        int numCities = isConnected.length;

        // Initialize the count of connected components.
        int count = 0;

        // Initialize the visited array.
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[numCities];

        // Iterate through all cities.
        for (int city = 0; city < numCities; city++) {
            // If the city is not visited, do a DFS from the city and increment the count.
            if (!visited[city]) {
                depthFirstSearch(city, numCities, isConnected, visited);
                count++;
            }
        }

        // Return the count of connected components.
        return count;
    }
