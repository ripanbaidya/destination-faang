## Description
The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(n) is the run-length encoding of countAndSay(n - 1).
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string "3322251" we replace "33" with "23", replace "222" with "32", replace "5" with "15" and replace "1" with "11". Thus the compressed string becomes "23321511".

Given a positive integer n, return the nth element of the count-and-say sequence.

**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = RLE of "1" = "11"
countAndSay(3) = RLE of "11" = "21"
countAndSay(4) = RLE of "21" = "1211"

Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
Explanation:
This is the base case.
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= n <= 30


## [Expected Approach] Iterative Solution

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    /**
     * Compresses a given character array into a string
     * by counting consecutive occurrences of the same digit 
     * and appending the count followed by the digit to build the new string. 
     */
    public String compress(char[] chars) {
        StringBuilder compressedString = new StringBuilder(); // 222 -> 32 (count, value)
        int arrayLength = chars.length;
        int writeIndex = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < arrayLength; i ++){
            int count = 0; 
            char currentCharacter = chars[i];

            while(i < arrayLength && currentCharacter == chars[i]){
                count ++;
                i ++;
            }

            compressedString.append(Integer.toString(count)); // add the count
            compressedString.append(currentCharacter); // add current character
            
            i --; // make sure rollback to previous chracters
        }
        return compressedString.toString();
    }

    /**
     * Generates the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.
     * The core logic involves counting consecutive occurrences of the same digit 
     * and appending the count followed by the digit to build the new string. 
     */
    public String countAndSay(int n){
        if(n == 1) return "1";
        
        String previousTerm = "1"; 
        String result = "";  

        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i ++){  
            result = compress(previousTerm.toCharArray());
            previousTerm = result;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
