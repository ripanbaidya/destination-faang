## Description
Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:

```
Symbol	Value
I	1
V	5
X	10
L	50
C	100
D	500
M	1000
```
Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

- If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.

- If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).

- Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.
Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.


**Examples**

```
Example 1
Input: num = 3749
Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"
Explanation:

3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
  40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
   9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places
```

```
Example 2
Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation:
50 = L
 8 = VIII
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= num <= 3999

## [Optimal Approach]

### Intuition
To convert an **integer to Roman numerals**, we need to keep **subtracting the largest possible Roman value** until the number becomes 0.

Roman numerals are built from a set of known values like:
- `M` (1000), `CM` (900), `D` (500), `CD` (400), ...
- So, we create **two arrays**:
  - One for **values**: like `[1000, 900, 500, ..., 1]`
  - One for **symbols**: like `["M", "CM", "D", ..., "I"]`

Then, we **loop from largest to smallest** value:
- While `num >= value[i]`, subtract the value and append the corresponding Roman symbol to result.

### Algorithm
1. Create a **value array** and **symbol array** in increasing order.
2. Start from the **end** of the array (largest values).
3. While `num >= val[i]`:
   - Subtract `val[i]` from `num`
   - Append `roman[i]` to result
4. Repeat until `num` becomes 0.
5. Return the result as a string.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String intToRoman(int number) {
        StringBuilder romanNumeral = new StringBuilder();

        String[] romanSymbols = {"I", "IV", "V", "IX", "X", "XL", "L", "XC", "C", "CD", "D", "CM", "M"};
        int[] romanValues = {1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 40, 50, 90, 100, 400, 500, 900, 1000};
        int totalSymbols = romanValues.length;

        for (int i = totalSymbols - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            while (number >= romanValues[i]) {
                romanNumeral.append(romanSymbols[i]);
                number -= romanValues[i];
            }
            if (number == 0) break;
        }
        return romanNumeral.toString();
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - Even though there are loops, the input range is fixed: `1 <= num <= 3999`
  - So max Roman characters we’ll append is limited → treated as constant time

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - No extra space used apart from result (`StringBuilder`), which is also bounded
