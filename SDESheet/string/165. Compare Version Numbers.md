## Description
Given two version strings, version1 and version2, compare them. A version string consists of revisions separated by dots '.'. The value of the revision is its integer conversion ignoring leading zeros.

To compare version strings, compare their revision values in left-to-right order. If one of the version strings has fewer revisions, treat the missing revision values as 0.

Return the following:

- If version1 < version2, return -1.
- If version1 > version2, return 1.
- Otherwise, return 0.
 
**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: version1 = "1.2", version2 = "1.10"
Output: -1
Explanation:
version1's second revision is "2" and version2's second revision is "10": 2 < 10, so version1 < version2.

Example 2:
Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
Output: 0
Explanation:
Ignoring leading zeroes, both "01" and "001" represent the same integer "1".

Example 3:
Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0.0"
Output: 0
Explanation:
version1 has less revisions, which means every missing revision are treated as "0".
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500
- version1 and version2 only contain digits and '.'.
- version1 and version2 are valid version numbers.
- All the given revisions in version1 and version2 can be stored in a 32-bit integer.


## [Expected Approach]

### Intution
* Versions are made up of revision numbers separated by dots ("."), like "1.0.1" → [1, 0, 1].
* To compare two versions, compare each part from left to right:
    * Compare first part of v1 with first part of v2, then second, then third, etc.
    * If one version is shorter (e.g., "1.0" vs "1.0.0.0"), treat the missing parts as 0.
* Leading zeros don't matter because we parse parts as integers (Integer.parseInt("001") → 1).
  
### Algorithm
1. Split both strings by "." to get version parts.
    * "1.0.1" → ["1", "0", "1"]

2. Iterate through both arrays up to the length of the longer one.
3. At each index i:
    * If that index exists in the version, parse it as integer.
    * Else, treat it as 0.
4. Compare the integers:
    * If v1[i] > v2[i] → return 1
    * If v1[i] < v2[i] → return -1
    * If equal, continue to next part

5. If all parts are equal → return 0

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int compareVersionNumbers(String version1, String version2) {
        String[] version1Parts = version1.split("\\.");
        String[] version2Parts = version2.split("\\.");
        
        int maxLength = Math.max(version1Parts.length, version2Parts.length);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < maxLength; i++) {
            int revision1 = i < version1Parts.length ? Integer.parseInt(version1Parts[i]) : 0;
            int revision2 = i < version2Parts.length ? Integer.parseInt(version2Parts[i]) : 0;

            if (revision1 > revision2) return 1;
            if (revision1 < revision2) return -1;
        }

        return 0;  // All revisions are equal
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: `O(max(N, M))`
    - Where N & M are number of parts in v1 & v2 
    - We iterate up to max(N, M) once.
    - Parsing strings to integers takes O(1) per part (since parts are short, usually 1-3 digits).

- Space Complexity: `O(N + M)`
    - Due to the string arrays created by .split() (no additional space beyond that).
