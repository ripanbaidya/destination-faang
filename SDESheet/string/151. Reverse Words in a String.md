## Description
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

Example 2:
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

Example 3:
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
- There is at least one word in s.
 

**Follow-up:** If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?


## [Naive Approach] Using Stack - O(n) Time and O(n) Space

### Intuition
The problem asks us to reverse the **order of words**, not the characters. The **stack** data structure follows **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** behavior, which is perfect for reversing the order of elements.

So, the idea is
- Traverse the string and extract words.
- Push each word into a stack (this reverses the order).
- Pop each word and build the reversed sentence.

### Approach
1. Initialize
   - A `Stack<StringBuilder>` to store words.
   - A temporary `StringBuilder` (`temp`) to build each word.
   - A result `StringBuilder` (`reversedString`) to store the final string.

2. Traverse the input string:
   - For each character:
     - If it's not a space, add it to `temp`.
     - If it **is** a space and `temp` is not empty, push `temp` to the stack and reset `temp`.

3. After the loop:
   - If `temp` still has a word, push it to the stack.

4. Build the result:
   - Pop all words from the stack and append them to `reversedString`.
   - Add a space after each word.

5. Return `reversedString.toString().trim()` to remove the trailing space.
   
### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String inputString) {
        Stack<StringBuilder> wordStack = new Stack<>();
        StringBuilder reversedSentence = new StringBuilder(); // To store the final result
        StringBuilder currentWord = new StringBuilder(); // To build each word

        for (int i = 0; i < inputString.length(); i++) {
            char currentChar = inputString.charAt(i);

            if (currentChar != ' ') {
                currentWord.append(currentChar);
            } else {
                // Add word to stack if it's not empty
                if (currentWord.length() > 0) {
                    wordStack.push(currentWord);
                    currentWord = new StringBuilder(); // Or use: currentWord.setLength(0);
                }
            }
        }

        // Add the last word if any
        if (currentWord.length() > 0) {
            wordStack.push(currentWord);
        }

        // Pop from stack and build the reversed sentence
        while (!wordStack.isEmpty()) {
            reversedSentence.append(wordStack.pop());
            reversedSentence.append(" ");
        }

        // Remove trailing space and return
        return reversedSentence.toString().trim();
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis 

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the stack and resulting string.


## [Approach 2] Expexted Using Regex(slower)

### Intution
We want to split the string into words while ignoring multiple spaces, tabs, or newlines between them. Using regex `\\s+` lets us treat all consecutive whitespace as a single delimiter, which cleans up the input neatly.

### Algorithm
1. Trim the string to remove leading/trailing spaces.
2. Use split("\\s+") to split the string by one or more whitespace characters.
3. Traverse the array from end to start, and append each word to a StringBuilder.
4. Remove the trailing space by taking a substring or using trim().

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String input) {
        // Split the input string into individual words
        String[] words = input.split(" ");
        StringBuilder reversedSentence = new StringBuilder();

        // Iterate over all words in reverse order
        for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // If the current word is not empty, add it to the result
            if (words[i].length() > 0) {
                reversedSentence.append(words[i]);
                reversedSentence.append(" ");
            }
        }

        // Remove trailing space and return the result
        return reversedSentence.toString().trim();
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis 
- Time Complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string.
- Space Complexity: `O(n)`


## [Approach 3] Without Regex (Faster)

### Intution
We want to split the string by spaces, but we manually skip over any empty strings that result from consecutive spaces. This gives us the same result without the cost of regex.

### Algorithm
1. Use split(" ") to split by single spaces.
2. Loop from the end to start of the array.
3. Append only non-empty strings to the result.
4. Remove the trailing space at the end.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String inputString) {
        // Split the input string into words based on spaces
        String[] wordsArray = inputString.split(" ");
        StringBuilder reversedSentence = new StringBuilder();
        int wordsCount = wordsArray.length;

        // Traverse the array from the last word to the first
        for (int i = wordsCount - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Append non-empty words to the result
            if (wordsArray[i].length() > 0) {
                reversedSentence.append(wordsArray[i]).append(" ");
            }
        }
        
        // Convert StringBuilder to String and trim any trailing spaces
        return reversedSentence.toString().trim();
    }
}
```

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
