## Description
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

Example 3:
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= s.length <= 15
- s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
- It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].


## [Optimal Approach]

### Intuition

We want to **convert a Roman numeral string into an Integer**.  
Now, we know that in Roman numerals, some numbers like **4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD), 900 (CM)** use **two characters** to represent a single value.

So, while traversing the string, we can't just add the value of each character blindly.  
We need to **check for such special cases** where **a pair of characters represent a value**.  
If we find such a pair, we add its value and **skip the next character** (because it's already used).  
If not, we just add the single character’s value as usual.


### Algorithm

1. Loop through each character of the string.
2. For every character:
   - Get the current and the next character.
3. Use `if-else` to check if `current + next` forms a **known special pair**:
   - If yes → add that value and skip the next character (i.e., do `i++`)
   - Else → use `switch` to add normal value of current character
4. Repeat this until you reach the end of the string.
5. Finally, return the result.


### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int romanToInt(String romanNumeral) {
        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < romanNumeral.length(); i++) {
            char currentChar = romanNumeral.charAt(i);
            char nextChar = (i + 1 < romanNumeral.length()) ? romanNumeral.charAt(i + 1) : '\0';

            int currentValue = getRomanNumeralValue(currentChar);
            int nextValue = getRomanNumeralValue(nextChar);

            if (isSpecialPair(currentChar, nextChar)) {
                result += nextValue - currentValue;
                i++; // skip the next character since it's part of a special pair
            } else {
                result += currentValue;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    private int getRomanNumeralValue(char character) {
        switch (character) {
            case 'I':
                return 1;
            case 'V':
                return 5;
            case 'X':
                return 10;
            case 'L':
                return 50;
            case 'C':
                return 100;
            case 'D':
                return 500;
            case 'M':
                return 1000;
            default:
                return 0;
        }
    }

    private boolean isSpecialPair(char currentChar, char nextChar) {
        return (currentChar == 'I' && nextChar == 'V') ||
               (currentChar == 'I' && nextChar == 'X') ||
               (currentChar == 'X' && nextChar == 'L') ||
               (currentChar == 'X' && nextChar == 'C') ||
               (currentChar == 'C' && nextChar == 'D') ||
               (currentChar == 'C' && nextChar == 'M');
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`  
  → We process each character only once (even special pairs are handled in one step).

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`  
  → No extra space used apart from result and a few variables.
