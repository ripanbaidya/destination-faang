## Description
Given two strings a and b, return the minimum number of times you should repeat string a so that string b is a substring of it. If it is impossible for b​​​​​​ to be a substring of a after repeating it, return -1.

Notice: string "abc" repeated 0 times is "", repeated 1 time is "abc" and repeated 2 times is "abcabc"

**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: a = "abcd", b = "cdabcdab"
Output: 3
Explanation: We return 3 because by repeating a three times "abcdabcdabcd", b is a substring of it.

Example 2:
Input: a = "a", b = "aa"
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
- a and b consist of lowercase English letters.


## [Naive Approach] / Greedy

### Intuition
We want to repeat string `a` enough times so that string `b` becomes a **substring** of the repeated version.  
Instead of blindly repeating `a` infinitely, we can **greedily repeat `a` until the repeated string's length ≥ b's length**, since anything less can't possibly contain `b`.

We may need to append `a` **one more time** to handle cases where `b` starts near the end of one repetition and spills into the next.

If, after these checks, `b` is still not a substring, then it's **not possible** to form `b` using repeated `a`.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize an empty `StringBuilder` and a `count = 0`.
2. Keep appending `a` to the `StringBuilder` until its length ≥ `b.length()`.
3. After this loop:
   - Check if `b` is now a substring.
   - If not, append `a` one more time (to cover overlapping cases).
4. If still not a match, return `-1`.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int repeatedStringMatch(String a, String b) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int count = 0;

        // Keep appending a until sb length is at least b's length
        while (sb.length() < b.length()) {
            sb.append(a);
            count++;
        }

        // Check if b is a substring
        if (sb.toString().contains(b)) return count;

        // Append one more time to handle overlap
        sb.append(a);
        if (sb.toString().contains(b)) return count + 1;

        return -1;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis:

#### Time Complexity: **O(m * n)**  
- Let `m = a.length()`, `n = b.length()`
- Worst case: we append `a` around `(n / m) + 2` times.  
- `sb.toString().contains(b)` takes **O(n * m)** in worst case due to naive substring check (though in Java it uses efficient algorithms under the hood).

#### Space Complexity: **O(m + n)**  
- We use extra space in `StringBuilder`, which can grow up to `(n + m)` size.



## [Expected Approach] Rabin-Karp(Rolling Hash)

### Intuition
We are given two strings `a` and `b`, and we need to find the minimum number of times `a` must be repeated such that `b` becomes a **substring** of the repeated string.

Instead of using `.contains()` or brute force, we can apply **Rabin-Karp (rolling hash)** to efficiently check if `b` is a substring of repeated `a`.



## Approach (Rabin-Karp Hashing)

1. Repeat `a` until the repeated string is **at least the length of `b`**.
2. Use **Rabin-Karp** to check whether `b` is a substring of the repeated string.
3. If not found, append `a` one more time to handle overlap cases (e.g., `b` starts at the end of one repeat and continues into the next).
4. If still not found, return `-1`.


### Code (Rabin-Karp Based Solution)
```java
class Solution {
    private final static int d = 256; // character base (ASCII)
    private final static int q = 101; // a prime number for hashing

    public int repeatedStringMatch(String a, String b) {
        int m = b.length();

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int count = 0;

        // Repeat 'a' until sb length >= b.length()
        while (sb.length() < b.length()) {
            sb.append(a);
            count++;
        }

        // Try once
        if (rabinKarp(sb.toString(), b)) return count;

        // Try once more to account for boundary overlap
        sb.append(a);
        if (rabinKarp(sb.toString(), b)) return count + 1;

        return -1;
    }

    private boolean rabinKarp(String text, String pattern) {
        int n = text.length();
        int m = pattern.length();
        int t = 0, p = 0; // hash for text and pattern
        int h = 1;

        // h = pow(d, m-1) % q
        for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; i++) {
            h = (h * d) % q;
        }

        // Initial hash values
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            p = (d * p + pattern.charAt(i)) % q;
            t = (d * t + text.charAt(i)) % q;
        }

        // Slide the pattern over text
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - m; i++) {
            if (p == t) {
                boolean match = true;
                for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                    if (text.charAt(i + j) != pattern.charAt(j)) {
                        match = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (match) return true;
            }

            if (i < n - m) {
                t = (d * (t - text.charAt(i) * h) + text.charAt(i + m)) % q;
                if (t < 0) t += q;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**: `O((m + n) * k)`, where:
  - `m = a.length()`
  - `n = b.length()`
  - `k` is the number of character comparisons when hash matches (in worst case)
  - Rolling hash is **O(n)**, but if hashes match, we compare characters one-by-one (`O(k)`).

- **Space Complexity:** `O(m + n)` for the repeated string and pattern.
