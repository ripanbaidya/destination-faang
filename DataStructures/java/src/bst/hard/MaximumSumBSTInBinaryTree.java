/**
 * Given a binary tree root, return the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).
 * Assume a BST is defined as follows:
 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 *
 * Input: root = [1,4,3,2,4,2,5,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,6]
 * Output: 20
 * Explanation: Maximum sum in a valid Binary search tree is obtained in root node with key equal to 3.
