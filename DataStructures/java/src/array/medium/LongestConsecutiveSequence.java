 * Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements
 * sequence. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
